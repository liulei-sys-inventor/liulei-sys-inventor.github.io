Brief Biography
======

Lei Liu is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at  Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences  (CAS), where he leads the Sys-Inventor Lab, which is a part of the State  Key Lab of Computer Architecture. He joined the ICT faculty in 2014  after receiving his Ph.D. degrees in computer science from ICT. Besides,  he received his MS degree in software system design at University of  Science and Technology of China (USTC), and BS degree in computer  science at Dalian University of Technology (DLUT), respectively. He  spent several years in industry as a software engineer and senior  software architect. He was a visiting scholar in CS at the University of  Rochester (UR).

He has led research projects that have advanced the Memory  Systems, OS, Performance Isolation, and Profiling: 1) Technical  evolutions for memory partitioning approaches; 2) Hybrid memory  management in OS for systems using NVM-DRAM; and 3) Next generation OS -  leveraging ML to build core components in OS. As the leading author,  Lei has published research articles regarding the architecture and  operating system in venues that include ISCA, PACT, IEEE TC, TPDS, ACM  TACO, ICCD,and others. Recently, his work has focused on the  intersection of the hybrid memory system (DRAM-NVM), OS for emerging  technologies (including GPU, Graph, Quantum Computing as well as AI).

Lei Liu is an IEEE and ACM member, has served as the PC/ERC  members, chairs for a number of main stream conferences (e.g., MICRO,  HPCA, SC, PACT, ICS, IISWC, ISCA, ASPLOS, ICCD, ICPP, IPDPS, HPCC,  General co-Chair of IEEE IISWC-2020, ACM ICS-2018) and reviewer for  well-known Transactions (ACM TACO, ACM JETC, ACM TECS, ACM TRTS, IEEE  TPDS). He received a number of awards.
